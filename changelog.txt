- Revision A (22 september 2006):

  * Initial release

- Revision B (24 september 2006):

  * Some kernel prx's didn't load because the kernel tried to load them to user partition. 
    This problem affected devhook.prx and some other kernel prx's.
    This problem has been fixed.

- Revision B with better binary loader in the tiff (25 september)
   
  * Changed the binary loader to use the one from tiffsdk 1.1 that has better stability.
    No changes on the core.

- Revision C (29 september 2006):

  * User mode static ELF's are now starting to work.
    Tested with SNES TYL 0.3 (user mode version), PSPMaster and  CPS2PSP 1.0 (user mode version).
    Kernel mode static elf's are still not supported, they are a very odd case in 1.XX of kernel
    code loaded to user memory. 
    Kernel Homebrew for 2.71 has to be written with a user main elf/prx that load kernel prx's.
    Note that the homebrew must be in a true pbp, not kxploited!.

  * User mode prx's could load other user mode prx's, but kernel mode prx's couldn't load user mode
    prx's. 
    This is fixed.

  * Patched the firmware to allow it to understand the old SFO format. 
    (avoiding the error of data is corrupted)

  * Added a small win32 binary that will give you a hint about if a homebrew can work or not in 
    the current release. Note that this is only a hint.
