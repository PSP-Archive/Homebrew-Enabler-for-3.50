303 HEN Noobz Downgrader Guide
------------------------------

Here is a guide for downgrading any current PSP hardware version
(TA-079 - TA-086) from firmware 3.10-3.50 to 1.50.

VERY IMPORTANT:
  If you have a TA082+ motherboard and you downgrade to 1.50,
  currently you will be unable to upgrade to 3.30+ Sony firmware.
  This is due to Sony blocking updates when the PSP has been
  modified to run 1.50. There will be an application released
  later which will allow users to revert the changes. If you
  are using a TA082 motherboard then I would suggest just using
  1.50 or OE until an application is released.

IMPORTANT:
  The Noobz team is strongly against piracy, and we're not just
  saying that to cover our butts. When you pirate games, you're
  removing the incentive for game and console makers to continue
  making fun things for us to play with. We are releasing this
  downgrader because we believe that using your PSP to its full
  potential and being able to customize it and run homebrew code
  is a fair use right that should be available to everyone.
  Please purchase games that you intend to play. Thanks!

Instructions
------------
Here are the steps to downgrade any 3.50 PSP to 1.50:

1  - If you have a 3.50 PSP skip to step 6

2  - Download 3.50 update from here:
	http://dl.qj.net/PSP-Firmware-3.50-(North-America)-PSP/pg/12/fid/13840/catid/163

3  - Unzip and place the file in <pspdrive>:/PSP/GAME/UPDATE

4  - On the PSP, run the 3.50 update from the memory stick under the Game menu.

5  - Delete <pspdrive>:/PSP/GAME/UPDATE

6  - Copy the contents of the folder MS_ROOT from the 3.50 downgrader ZIP to
     the memory stick

7  - Unzip the 1.50 update to a temporary folder. Rename the EBOOT.PBP to
     UPDATE.PBP and copy it to <pspdrive>:/PSP/GAME/UPDATE/ .   DO NOT
     OVERWRITE PSP/GAME/UPDATE/EBOOT.PBP!

8  - Load Lumines and press x to start the game

9  - The screen will clear to black and fill with a light blue colour, then
     the PSP will reset itself

10 - Check that HEN is running by going to system settings, then to
     "System Information" and it should show up as system version
     350 HEN

11 - If it is showing up as HEN then go to the memory stick and
     run the x.yz update

12 - If you have an unpatched TA-082 or higher motherboard, you will be
     prompted to allow the downgrader to patch your motherboard so it
     can be safely downgraded.  The downgrader will not let you proceed
     without patching, if your motherboard requires it.

13 - Before the downgrader does anything to your PSP it will ask
     for you to agree to what it is doing, if you no longer want to
     continue press the Right Shoulder Button (R-TRIGGER).

14 - Once you have agreed to start the downgrade do not unplug the
     PSP, or try and restart it

15 - Once finished the PSP will ask you to press X, and reset itself

16 - If it comes up saying that the settings are corrupt, press x
     to continue, this will mean you will need to re-enter the
     settings for network connections into your PSP, otherwise go to
     step 18

17 - Load the included NetConfigBackup application in your PSP, and select to
     restore, this will take the backup that was done of the network config
     that was done automatically during the downgrade.

18 - All done now :-)  Hopefully you now have a 1.50 PSP.  Enjoy it responsibly.


Troubleshooting
---------------
- If when trying to restore the network config using netconf backup you
  find that it gives you an error on the downgraded 1.50 PSP, try adding
  a temporary network config, then deleting it and run the netconf backup
  again.
